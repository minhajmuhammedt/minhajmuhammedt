# Minhaj Muhammed T
## Aspiring Data Analyst | Proficient in Excel, SQL, Power BI | Passionate About Turning Data into Business Solutions
Iâ€™m a Mechanical Engineering graduate transitioning into Data Analytics, with a strong foundation in problem-solving, structured documentation, and analytical thinking. Over the past year, I have worked on multiple hands-on projects in Power BI, SQL, Python, Excel, and Statistics, where I applied data-driven approaches to uncover insights, build dashboards, and support decision-making.

I am passionate about turning raw data into meaningful storiesâ€”whether through interactive dashboards, optimized SQL queries, or statistical models. My projects span domains like e-commerce sales, airline operations, employee-project analysis, and real-time business case studies, each sharpening my ability to deliver actionable insights.
